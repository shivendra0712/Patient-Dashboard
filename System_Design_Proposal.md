## 3. Technical Architecture

### 3.1 High-Level Architecture

The application follows a client-server architecture with the following components:

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│                 │     │                 │     │                 │
│  Client         │     │  Server         │     │  Database       │
│  (React/Vite)   │────▶│  (Node.js/      │────▶│  (MongoDB)      │
│                 │     │   Express)      │     │                 │
│                 │     │                 │     │                 │
└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
```

- **Developer Experience**: The combination of React and Vite provides an excellent developer experience with fast refresh and efficient bundling.

### 3.3 Backend Language/Framework

**Choice: Node.js with Express.js**

**Justification:**
- **JavaScript Across Stack**: Using JavaScript for both frontend and backend allows for code sharing and consistent development experience.
- **Non-blocking I/O**: Node.js's event-driven, non-blocking I/O model is well-suited for handling multiple concurrent requests in a dashboard application.
- **Express.js Middleware**: Express provides a robust middleware system for request processing, authentication, and error handling.
- **RESTful API Support**: Express makes it straightforward to implement RESTful APIs with clean route definitions.
- **Scalability**: Node.js can handle a large number of concurrent connections with minimal overhead, making it suitable for scaling as the user base grows.

### 3.4 Database

**Choice: MongoDB**

**Justification:**
- **Schema Flexibility**: MongoDB's document-based structure allows for flexible schemas that can evolve as the application's requirements change.
- **JSON-like Documents**: MongoDB's BSON format aligns well with JavaScript objects, making data manipulation more intuitive.
- **Scalability**: MongoDB's horizontal scaling capabilities through sharding support future growth.
- **Performance**: MongoDB provides good read/write performance for the types of queries needed in a health dashboard.
- **Mongoose ODM**: Using Mongoose provides schema validation, middleware, and other features that enhance MongoDB's capabilities.

#### Schema Design

**User Schema:**
```javascript
{
  name: String,
  email: String,
  password: String (hashed),
  role: String (enum: ['patient', 'admin']),
  profileImage: String,
  phoneNumber: String,
  address: {
    street: String,
    city: String,
    state: String,
    zipCode: String,
    country: String
  },
  healthMetrics: {
    height: Number,
    targetWeight: Number,
    bloodGroup: String,
    age: Number,
    gender: String,
    dateOfBirth: Date
  },
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

**Weight Record Schema:**
```javascript
{
  user: ObjectId (ref: 'User'),
  weight: Number,
  date: Date,
  notes: String,
  startingWeight: Number,
  currentWeight: Number,
  weightGoal: Number,
  weightChange: Number
}
```

**Medication Schema:**
```javascript
{
  user: ObjectId (ref: 'User'),
  name: String,
  dosage: String,
  frequency: String,
  timeOfDay: [String],
  startDate: Date,
  endDate: Date,
  instructions: String,
  prescribedBy: String,
  status: String (enum: ['active', 'completed', 'discontinued']),
  adherenceRate: Number,
  refillReminder: Boolean,
  refillDate: Date
}
```

**Shipment Schema:**
```javascript
{
  user: ObjectId (ref: 'User'),
  trackingNumber: String,
  carrier: String,
  medications: [{ type: ObjectId, ref: 'Medication' }],
  status: String (enum: ['ordered', 'shipped', 'delivered', 'delayed']),
  estimatedDelivery: Date,
  actualDelivery: Date,
  shippingAddress: {
    street: String,
    city: String,
    state: String,
    zipCode: String,
    country: String
  },
  notifications: Boolean
}
```

### 3.5 API Design

**Choice: RESTful API**

**Justification:**
- **Standardized Methods**: REST uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) that align well with CRUD operations.
- **Statelessness**: RESTful APIs are stateless, making them easier to scale and maintain.
- **Resource-Based**: The resource-based approach maps well to the domain entities (users, weight records, medications).
- **Client-Server Separation**: Clear separation of concerns between client and server components.
- **Cacheability**: REST's caching capabilities can improve performance for frequently accessed data.

#### API Endpoints

**Authentication:**
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Register a new user
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Authenticate a user
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user
- `GET /api/auth/logout` - Logout user

**User Profile:**
- `GET /api/users/profile` - Get user profile
- `PUT /api/users/profile` - Update user profile

**Weight Management:**
- `GET /api/weight` - Get all weight records
- `POST /api/weight` - Create a weight record
- `GET /api/weight/:id` - Get a specific weight record
- `PUT /api/weight/:id` - Update a weight record
- `DELETE /api/weight/:id` - Delete a weight record
- `GET /api/weight/goals` - Get weight goals
- `POST /api/weight/goals` - Update weight goals

**Medication Management:**
- `GET /api/medications` - Get all medications
- `POST /api/medications` - Create a medication
- `GET /api/medications/:id` - Get a specific medication
- `PUT /api/medications/:id` - Update a medication
- `DELETE /api/medications/:id` - Delete a medication



### 3.6 Authentication Strategy

**Choice: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**

**Justification:**
- **Stateless Authentication**: JWTs allow for stateless authentication, reducing server-side storage requirements.
- **Cross-Domain Support**: JWTs work well across different domains, supporting potential future expansion.
- **Security**: When implemented correctly with proper expiration and refresh mechanisms, JWTs provide good security.
- **Performance**: Token verification is fast and doesn't require database lookups for each request.
- **Client-Side Storage**: Tokens can be stored in localStorage or HTTP-only cookies, providing flexibility in implementation.

#### Implementation Details:
- Token generation upon successful login/registration
- Token storage in localStorage on the client
- Token inclusion in Authorization header for API requests
- Token verification middleware on protected routes
- Token expiration and refresh mechanism

## 4. Additional Technical Considerations

- Local component state for UI-specific state

### 4.2 Data Visualization
- Chart.js for weight tracking visualizations
- React-Chartjs-2 for React integration

### 4.3 Styling
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling approach
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop views

### 4.4 Performance Optimization
- Code splitting for reduced bundle size
- Lazy loading of components
- Memoization of expensive calculations

### 4.5 Security Measures
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- CORS configuration
- Input validation and sanitization
- Protected routes with middleware
- Environment variable management for sensitive information

## 5. Conclusion

The proposed technical architecture leverages modern web development technologies and best practices to create a robust, scalable, and maintainable Patient Dashboard application. The combination of React/Vite for the frontend, Node.js/Express for the backend, MongoDB for the database, RESTful API design, and JWT authentication provides a solid foundation for building a feature-rich health management system.

This architecture supports the current requirements while allowing for future expansion and feature additions with minimal architectural changes.
